## Motivation
{{< hint info >}}
In psychology, reactance is an unpleasant motivational reaction to offers, persons, rules, or regulations that threaten or eliminate specific behavioral freedoms.

Reactance helps you bypass government's internet censorships. It itself is not a VPN or proxy protocol but it's an automation that sets up finely selected proxy and VPN servers that can bypass these restrictions.

## Getting Started

Reactance doesn't have a client of its own. Instead, we provide documentations and credentials for you to know how to connect to the proxy and VPN servers through specific clients. The clients are organized based on OSes. Simply click on the client names on the left navigation bar based on your Operating System to know how to connect to the servers.

**Note:** Please setup the VPN connections within 24 hour period because the website will be deleted after 24 hours and you wouldn't be able to access it.
